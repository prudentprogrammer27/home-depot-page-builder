Over the years I have used a wide variety of drivers and many times you can''t feel, let alone hear, much of a difference; with this Atomic driver you can. Not only is the a noticeable difference going from speed to speed, I also really like the sensitive nature of the trigger. I like the compact nature of it of course, I would only recommend that it is sold with a power stack battery. The compact, yet powerful nature of those two products combined is amazing.',

  '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros: ~ Fantastic kit - perfect for DIYers or professionals alike. ~ Compact and lightweight ~ Excellent ergonomics ~ Well built and exceptional quality Cons: ~ Not worth the upgrade if you don''t need the drive''s space saving design. Overall: If this would be your first impact driver then look no further. Excellent build quality, power, and comfort. This kit also includes all the essentials to get started right away. Review: The DCF850 is a step-up compared to the DCF887 even though they have the same specs. (3 speed, 0-3800 impacts per minute, 20V) This kit comes with the ¼” impact driver, 5Ah battery, charger, toolbag, and belt clip. For me, as a DIYer, it''s all about the comfort and long-term use. When you hold the 850, it feels much less awkward compared to the 887. The 850 feels much more balanced due to its significantly shorter design. In pictures, it might not seem like that big of a deal to some but when space is needed, it''s a fantastic option! Prior to owning the 850, I had read a couple reviews stating that the 887 did a better job with certain screws (headlok, deck, etc..). This was not the case for myself, however. With the included 5Ah battery in this kit, it was just as forceful, if not moreso, than the 887. If you are torn between the two choices, without a doubt go with the 850. You aren''t sacrificing power, the available space in tight spots is increased, comfortability is fantastic, and the durability is top notch.',

My favorite enhancement to the now past model is the new 3 speed options. I now feel I have more control over the use of screws in that the speed is tempered. The brushless motor is so very smooth I can hardly imagine a better tool anywhere on the market. It also seems like the 3 LED lights are very bright as compared to the regular impact driver.',
